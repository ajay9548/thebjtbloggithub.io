# THE BJT TRANSISTOR 

the bjt transistor  is a integral circuit which is used in morden technology .such as computer ,androids robots many other technology which is a become essential part of morden soceity .
bjt is also known as biopolar juntion diode 
     
    



## Appendix


Bjt is the solid  device which flow current   in the circuit which control  the flow through third terminal  in the circuit  .Bipolar junction transistor (BJT) is the type of transistor and three-terminal semiconductor device, which has two p-n junctions. They are mainly used as amplifiers in electronic circuits. Both the electrons and holes will act as the charge carriers in the Bipolar junction transistor. Usually, the BJT transistors do not require any external DC current. This article explains transistors and types, characteristics and working principles Bjt is also knows as bipolar junction diode. Which has 3 terminal semiconductors device which is made up of 2 pn junction which amplify the current.
